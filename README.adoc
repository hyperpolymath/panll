**Environment for NeSy-Agentic Integrated Development**

PanLL (pronounced "parallel") is a Human-Things Interface (HTI) designed to facilitate a "Binary Star" co-orbit between a Human Operator and a Neurosymbolic Machine.

== Vision

This is not a passive text editor. It is an active, synchronous environment that manages Cognitive Ergonomics and kills Inertia.

== Architecture

=== The Three-Pane Parallel Layout

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Pane-L (Symbolic)|Strict logic, types, and constraints. "The Law" that governs neural inference.
|Pane-N (Neural)|Streaming "Inference Manifold" showing the Agent's internal monologue and OODA loop.
|Pane-W (World)|Central shared canvas (The Barycentre) where results manifest.
|===

=== Core Systems

* **Anti-Crash Library**: Logical Circuit Breaker preventing unvalidated neural output from reaching the Barycentre
* **Vexometer**: Real-time friction/cognitive load monitoring with anti-inflammatory UI adjustments
* **Contractiles**: Adaptive state contracts between Operator and Machine
* **Feedback-O-Tron**: Community-driven performance reporting and constraint suggestions

== Technical Stack
